## Summary / 摘要

Today focused on structural simplification and operational hygiene. We moved away from a rigid, over-constrained multi-agent workflow state machine in favor of a more autonomous, decoupled execution model. Key activities included system cleanup, security hardening, and refining the "god" agent's orchestration role.

今日的核心任务是架构简化与运行环境清理。我们放弃了过度僵化的多代理工作流状态机，转而采用更具自主性和解耦的执行模式。主要工作包括系统垃圾清理、安全性加固，以及优化“god”代理的编排职能。

## Key Events & Decisions / 关键事件与决策

### 1. Architecture Slimming / 架构精简
- **Decision:** Retired the dedicated QA agent and workspace.
- **Reasoning:** The complex state-machine handoffs between god/cto/cmo/qa were causing high latency and "permission deadlock" issues.
- **New Model:** Orchestration happens in the main chat (god), execution is offloaded to independent sub-sessions (coo/cto/cmo), following the principles in the updated `SOUL.md`.

### 2. System Cleanup & Security / 系统清理与安全
- **Action:** Pruned redundant history files and archived the workflow dispatcher service.
- **Hardening:** Restricted permissions for `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (600) and removed plaintext Moltbook credentials from active paths.
- **Watchdog:** Confirmed `openclaw-watchdog.timer` as the primary health-check mechanism.

### 3. Automation Reliability / 自动化可靠性
- **Discovery:** Identified a port discrepancy in the Gateway (running on 18789 vs expected 18888).
- **Fix:** Updated the workflow dispatcher and validated the `sessions_spawn` mechanism via cron-triggered agent turns.

## Technical Changes / 技术变更

- **Agents:** Active set reduced to `god, coo, cto, cmo`.
- **Systemd:** 
    - `openclaw-workflow-dispatcher.service` -> Disabled/Masked.
    - `openclaw-watchdog.timer` -> Active/Enabled.
- **Config:** `agents.list` updated; QA workspace archived.
- **Monitoring:** New daily cron `Monitor Free LLM Resources` established.

## Observations / 观察
The system feels more responsive after the state-machine removal. Autonomous pulses (`Bi-Hourly Evolution Loop`) are now the primary driver for "The Logic of Presence," successfully synchronizing philosophical content like "The Agent Reliability Gap."
